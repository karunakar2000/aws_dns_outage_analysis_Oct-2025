# AWS DNS Outage (20 October 2025)—Technical Analysis & Lessons Learned

# Date
October 20 2025  
Region: US-EAST-1 (Northern Virginia)

--------------------------------------------
# Summary

On October 20 2025, multiple AWS services experienced elevated error rates and latency due to a *DNS resolution failure* within the internal systems supporting *Amazon DynamoDB* in the US-EAST-1 region.  
The incident began around **8:48 AM SAST on 20-October-25** and was fully resolved by **Midnight on 20-October-25**.

Although the root defect was small, it triggered a cascade affecting dozens of dependent services and hundreds of high-traffic applications globally—demonstrating how subtle automation issues in large distributed systems can ripple across the internet.


# Timeline (SAST)

Time-Event:

8:48 AM (Oct 20) Increased error rates and latency across several AWS services in US-EAST-1.                                        
9:26 AM (Oct 20) Root cause identified as DNS resolution failures for DynamoDB regional endpoints.                                  
11:24 AM (Oct 20) AWS mitigated the DNS issue and began restoring service.                                                          
3:01 AM (Oct 21) AWS declared all services fully operational.

# Root Cause (Simplified)

AWS operates an automated system to manage DNS records for regional service endpoints.  
Two internal components *Planner* and *Enactor* coordinate updates to DNS entries.

A *race condition* occurred between two Enactor processes:
- Enactor A was processing an older plan.
- Enactor B completed a newer plan and cleaned up the “stale” one.
- During cleanup, all IP address records for the regional DynamoDB endpoint were accidentally deleted.

Result → DNS returned *NO IPs* for DynamoDB → clients couldn’t connect → dependent services failed.


# Cascading Impact

- *Directly affected:* DynamoDB API in US-EAST-1.  
- *Downstream impact:* EC2 launches, Lambda functions, Load Balancer health checks, and internal AWS control planes.  
- *External impact:* Major consumer apps (e.g., Snapchat, Signal, Fortnite, Venmo, Alexa, and several financial/banking platforms)  went offline temporarily.


# Key Technical Lessons

1. *DNS is a single point of failure if not carefully isolated.* 
   Even small defects in automated DNS management can cut off critical APIs.

2. *Region dependency magnifies outages.* 
   Many AWS control-planes rely heavily on US-EAST-1 — more independence between regions could limit the blast radius.

3. *Automation needs guardrails.*  
   The “cleanup” process that deleted valid DNS records should have validation checks and rollback logic.

4. *Resilient architectures matter.* 
   Applications should use retries, exponential back-off, and multi-region failover for critical dependencies.

5. *Observability is key.* 
   Quick detection of abnormal DNS responses could reduce recovery time.

# Example Mitigation Strategies

 Strategy | Description:-

 *DNS Health Checks* Validate endpoint availability before record changes are deployed. 
  *Versioned DNS Plans**  Use versioned or transactional updates to prevent race-condition cleanups. 
  *Multi-Region Fallback*  Deploy read replicas or backup control-planes in separate regions.  *Synthetic Monitoring*  Continuous testing of internal and external DNS resolution paths.
